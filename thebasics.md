### **Code Implementation**
Hereâ€™s an extended Python framework incorporating some of these features:

                                ```python
                                import openai
                                import speech_recognition as sr
                                import pyttsx3
                                
                                # Initialize voice engine
                                engine = pyttsx3.init()
                                
                                def chat_with_ai(user_input):
                                    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                                        model="gpt-4",
                                        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
                                    )
                                    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
                                
                                def voice_interaction():
                                    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
                                    with sr.Microphone() as source:
                                        print("Listening...")
                                        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
                                        try:
                                            user_input = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
                                            print("You:", user_input)
                                            ai_response = chat_with_ai(user_input)
                                            print("AI:", ai_response)
                                            engine.say(ai_response)
                                            engine.runAndWait()
                                        except sr.UnknownValueError:
                                            print("Could not understand audio")
                                
                                while True:
                                    mode = input("Type 'text' for chat or 'voice' for voice interaction: ")
                                    if mode.lower() == "exit":
                                        break
                                    elif mode.lower() == "voice":
                                        voice_interaction()
                                    else:
                                        user_input = input("You: ")
                                        print("AI:", chat_with_ai(user_input))
                                ```

This script integrates **voice interaction**, **text-based chat**, and **AI-generated responses**. It can be expanded with **sentiment analysis**, **context retention**, and **task automation**.

Would you like me to refine any specific aspect or prioritize certain features? ðŸš€
